        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>To most of us, learning something “the hard way” implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe,
          should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make
          learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries
          in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more
          productive learners.

        <h2>My review</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Every few years, a book is published for a lay audience that reports major findings in cognitive psychology
            related to learning or what is sometimes called the science of learning. For those of us outside the
            discipline, they provide an accessible means of staying abreast of new findings as well as an opportunity to
            think of ways to make our teaching more effective. The trick of course, is translating general
            recommendations into specific pedagogical practices.</p>
          <p>Here we will share the central findings of one such book we have found useful, Brown, Roediger, and
            McDaniel's, Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning (The Belknap Press of Harvard University
            Press, 2014). We will present these as countering certain widely accepted myths about learning. We hope
            doing so will help you to design pedagogical strategies that promote learning that "sticks."</p>
